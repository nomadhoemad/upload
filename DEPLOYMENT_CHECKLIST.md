- [ ] DM cleanup task running (hourly)
- [ ] Cache cleanup working
- [ ] Lock cleanup working
- [ ] No unbounded dictionary growth

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Bot responds to commands quickly (<2s)
- [ ] Survey DMs sent in parallel (15 concurrent)
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Connection pool configured (5-30 connections)

## Security

### Secrets Management
- [ ] Bot token stored in environment variables
- [ ] No secrets in code or committed files
- [ ] `.gitignore` includes `.env` and sensitive files

- [ ] Bot has minimal required permissions
- [ ] No unnecessary elevated permissions

## Monitoring

### Railway (if using)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible
- [ ] Logs viewable
- [ ] Resource usage within limits
- [ ] Alerts configured (optional)

### Error Handling
- [ ] Error messages clear and helpful
- [ ] Critical errors logged
- [ ] Graceful degradation on failures
- [ ] Retry logic for Discord API calls

## Documentation

- [ ] README.md updated
- [ ] Command list accurate
- [ ] Deployment guide available
- [ ] Environment variables documented

## Backup & Recovery

- [ ] Database backup strategy planned
- [ ] `!exportdatabase` command tested
- [ ] Recovery procedure documented
- [ ] Regular export schedule established

## Final Checks

- [ ] Bot has been running for 24 hours without issues
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] All commands tested in production
- [ ] User feedback collected
- [ ] Performance acceptable for user count
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] No error spam in logs

## Post-Launch

### Week 1
- [ ] Monitor logs daily
- [ ] Check memory usage
- [ ] Verify DM cleanup running
- [ ] Test all major features
- [ ] Collect user feedback

### Month 1
- [ ] Review database size
- [ ] Export and backup data
- [ ] Check for any recurring errors
- [ ] Optimize based on usage patterns
- [ ] Update documentation as needed

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Check logs immediately** - Identify the error
2. **Revert code if needed:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```
3. **Railway auto-redeploys** with previous version
4. **Verify bot is working** with basic commands
5. **Review and fix** issues before redeploying
